<p>Routes may define <code>getChildRoutes</code> and <code>getComponents</code> methods, to specify a method of retrieving your modules, as we'll see.</p>

<p>Their example uses a declarative Object literal syntax, which I think can be improved upon:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var CourseRoute = {  
  path: 'course/:courseId',

  getChildRoutes(location, callback) {
    require.ensure([], function (require) {
      callback(null, [
        require('./routes/Announcements'),
        require('./routes/Assignments'),
        require('./routes/Grades'),
      ])
    })
  },

  getComponents(callback) {
    require.ensure([], function (require) {
      callback(null, require('./components/Course'))
    })
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>While this ticks most of the boxes, it means changing your usual usage somewhat.  Abstracting this away in say, into a dedicated class not only makes it more re-usable, but I think cleaner when implementing with React's render syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import {Route} from 'react-router';

export default class AsyncRoute extends Route {}

AsyncRoute.defaultProps = {  
    getComponents(location, callback) {
        System.import(this.async).then((mod) =&gt; {
            callback(null, mod.default);
        });
    },
    getChildRoutes (location, callback) {
        callback(null, this.children || []);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, extending the <strong>react-router's</strong> <code>Route</code> class to encapsulate the logic, has a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>We've internalized the logic making it far more portable, as well as defining the contract for module loading in one place.</p>

<p>Here I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs">SystemJS</a> module loader, to dynamically load the Route's component when required.</p>

<p>Their example uses <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">Webpack's</a> <code>require.ensure</code> mechanism, although you could swap this out for any module loader prefered.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class SomeView extends React.Component {  
   render() {
      return (
         &lt;Router history={history}&gt;
            &lt;Route path='/' component={HomeView}/&gt;
            &lt;AsyncRoute path='login' async="some/path/LoginView.js"/&gt;
         &lt;/Router&gt;
      )
   }
}

<p>In Play, you can’t – for obvious reasons – map the same url to different actions. This still applies to overloaded methods, as the framework still sees them as two separate methods, not simply two versions of the same thing!</p>

This is fortunately, easy to work around, by providing default parameters to a controller method, that can then decide which data it should load …  </p>

<p>If you need to package an arbitary set of asset files in a swc, the process is not only laborious, but actually unworkable. The Compc Ant task, provides the ‘include-file’ property, that lets you explicitly tell the compiler, that that file should be included in the resultant swc. On large scale enterprise applications – that may contain hundreds of asset files – there is no way of dynamically including the contents of a certain folder.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>After scratching my head for a considerable time, extending Compc and adding an easier mechanism to do this, seemed like the only option. So here it is – Compcx (CompcExtended).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[GlobalRemoteObjectFaultHandler Global Error Handler For Parsley 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Further to my <a href="http://blog.tiltdigital.com/adobe/globalremoteobjectfaulthandler-woes/">previous post</a>, I still couldn’t get the GlobalRemoteObjectFaultHandler Metadata tag to capture application exceptions being thrown globally.

<p>Seems the Cairngorm code base is still stuck pre-Parsley 3, almost a year and a half after it’s release.</p>

<p>Solution – Write the thing myself. Spent some time Googling for a solution, so I hope this might be useful to someone.</p>

<p>The functionality is encapsulated by two classes, and the extension initialised in a third. I’ve renamed the extension GlobalServiceFault – to keep a differentiation from the original. You can find the original ‘GlobalRemnoteObjectFaultHandler’ code here.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">package  
{
  import mx.rpc.events.FaultEvent;

  import org.spicefactory.parsley.core.builder.ObjectDefinitionBuilder;
  import org.spicefactory.parsley.core.builder.ObjectDefinitionDecorator;
  import org.spicefactory.parsley.core.scope.ScopeName;
  import org.spicefactory.parsley.messaging.MessageHandler;

  [Metadata(types="method")]
  public class GlobalServiceFault implements ObjectDefinitionDecorator
  {
      [Target]
      public var method:String;

      private var proxyRegistered:Boolean = false;

      public var scope:String = ScopeName.GLOBAL;

      public function decorate(builder:ObjectDefinitionBuilder):void
      {
          if (!proxyRegistered)
          {
              proxyRegistered = true;
              builder
                  .registry
                      .builders
                      .forClass(GlobalServiceFaultProcessor)
                      .asSingleton()
                      .register();
          }

          MessageHandler
              .forMethod(method)
                  .type(FaultEvent)
                  .scope(scope)
                  .selector(GlobalServiceFaultProcessor.messageSelector)
                      .apply(builder);
      }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the ObjectProcessor …  </p>

<pre><code>package  
{
  import mx.rpc.events.FaultEvent;
  import mx.rpc.remoting.RemoteObject;

  public class GlobalServiceFaultProcessor
  {
      public static const messageSelector:String = "cairngorm::globalFault";

      [MessageDispatcher]
      public var dispatcher:Function;

      [Observe(phase="preInit")]
      public function preInit(ro:RemoteObject):void
      {
          ro.addEventListener(FaultEvent.FAULT, handleFault);
      }

      [Observe(phase="postDestroy")]
      public function postDestroy(ro:RemoteObject):void
      {
          ro.removeEventListener(FaultEvent.FAULT, handleFault);
      }

      private function handleFault(event:FaultEvent):void
      {
          dispatcher(event, messageSelector);
      }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get it all working, you need to register the new Metadata with Parsley. <a href="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/docs/3.0/manual/extensions.php#metadata_register">(see here)</a></p>

<pre><code>Metadata.registerMetadataClass(GlobalServiceFault);  
</code></pre>

<p>and also specify to the mxmlc compiler to keep instances of your new metadata from being striped out.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://ensharable.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/globalremoteobjectfaulthandler/">this post</a> saved my bacon.</p>

<p>I had done just that – adding the CairngormIntegrationSupport tag to the ContextBuilder, but my downfail was the cairngorm namespace declaration being used.  I’d previously had <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/cairngorm/wiki/HowToUseCairngormPopup/">Cairngorm Popup Library</a> functionality imported, that had automatically added the following namespace for Cairngorm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://ns.adobe.com/cairngorm">http://ns.adobe.com/cairngorm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as the post above describes, to get the Cairngorm integration working, the Cairngorm namespace required is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>com.adobe.cairngorm.*</p>
</blockquote>

When you’re seemingly following all the rules as defined by the API you’re using, yet things just don’t want to work as you know they should.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">override protected function commitProperties():void  
{
     super.commitProperties();

     // do something

     invalidateSkinState();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I one such recent predicament, the <strong>getCurrentSkinState</strong> was simply not being triggered after issuing an ‘invalidateSkinState’. Upon testing, the issue seemed sporadic, with getCurrentSkinState being called most of the time, but not ALL the time as I would expect.</p>

<p>The case in question, was a custom PopUpButton, that simply wouldn’t close if clicking outside the target area. A multitude of breakpoints later with my temper rising, I finally discovered the issue. I’d been calling ‘invalidateSkinState’ inside ‘commitProperties’ but after the super.commitProperties call. Is better illustrated with some code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">override protected function commitProperties():void  
{
     super.commitProperties();

     // do something

     invalidateSkinState();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would seem like a sensible line of approach, considering the Spark component lifecycle architecture – pooling property changes on the component, assessing the components required new state in commitProperties, before commanding the skin to adopt the new state, and represent it visually.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the method ‘invalidateSkinState’ and ‘commitProperties’ on SkinnableComponent, to see what’s going wrong here…</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">public function invalidateSkinState():void  
{
     if (skinStateIsDirty)
          return; // State is already invalidated

     skinStateIsDirty = true;
     invalidateProperties();
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, skinStateIsDirty is set to true, before calling invalidateProperties. But because we’re in the middle of the current validation pass, the ‘invalidateProperties’ call in ‘invalidateSkinState’ method above, is never going to be honoured. And here’s why…</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">public function validateProperties():void  
{
     if (invalidatePropertiesFlag)
     {
          commitProperties();
          invalidatePropertiesFlag = false;
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! As you can see, after invoking commitProperties, the ‘invalidateProperitesFlag’ is immediately set to false. Thus, the invalidateProperties() call that was issued by the invalidateSinState() method will never result in another validation pass. It stands to reason, that trying to invalidate a component’s properties from inside commitProperties is a bad idea. Without such breakout logic, you’d experience an infinite loop of validation passes.</p>

<p>So, to conclude, by taking this into account, the problem is easily solved, by invalidating the skin’s state, before any validation pass occurs.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">override protected function commitProperties():void  
{
     invalidateSkinState();

     // do something

Without any customisation, clicking one of the buttons on a Spark ButtonBar, puts said Button into it’s selected state. Conversely, the Halo ButtonBar has the opposite – and should I say more desirable – effect, of not gluing the buttons state to selected.</p>

<p>It got me thinking as to how best to overcome this behaviour – or better still, give the user the option of having it behave in either manner.</p>

<p>My initial though was simply to create a new ButtonBarButtonSkin, which could ignore the ‘selectedStates’ group. But this would require a ButtonBarFirstButtonSkin, ButtonBarMiddleButtonSkin, ButtonBarLastButtonSkin and the parent ButtonBarSkin! Phew, too much work, and too obtrusive.</p>

<p>The second option was to simply listen to the ButtonBar’s IndexChangeEvent and set the selectedIndex back to -1 everytime a button was clicked. Given the three locations I might perform this:</p>

<p>Outside of the component by listening to the ButtonBar’s change event, <br>
Extending ButtonBar and hijacking the commitSelection method to revert the selection, or <br>
Changing the Skins state, in the skin, depending on the ‘requireSelection’ property <br>
I chose to go with the later, as it seemed the cleanest, most unobtrusive way, requiring the least amount of work, and the most reusable.</p>

<p>By listening for the ‘change’ event on the hostComponent in ButtonBarSkin, we could toggle the behaviour based on the ‘requireSelection’ property. When requireSelection = true, the ButtonBar behaves with it’s usual Spark behaviour. When requireSelection = false, it would adopt the legacy Halo behaviour.</p>

When entering a certain state in my SparkSkin, I needed to flash a couple of LEDs. The LED’d are basically ToggleButtons, so we basically just need to ‘toggle’ the ‘selected’ property at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The final solution proved a little more fiddly, but the result works well.</p>

<p>[SWF]/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/FlightDeckPanel.swf, 477, 175[/SWF]</p>

<h2 id="thesolution">The Solution  </h2>

<p>Using the SetAction Effect initially seemed like the way to go, but it hit me that this only seemed appropriate when combining in Sequence with an actual ‘visiual’ IEffect instance.</p>

<p>The SetAction Effect, does what it says on the tin, it’s simpl an action that sets a property. It doesn’t have a duration, or repeatCount etc. that other IEffects have. As such, the only way of achieving a sequence of SetActions, at specified intervals, would be to combine it with a ‘dummy’ Effect…</p>

<pre><code>```

But using ‘dummy’ effects, just to achieve our goal, is a hackish way of doing things. After considering different options, it occurred to me that similar functionality could be achieved using the Animate IEffect.

The Animate IEffect offers all of the functionality to specify a duration and repeat behaviour that I required, with the properties needing to be ‘Animated’ specified using a SimpleMotionPath instance. Bingo!

But no, this didn’t seem to work either, and upon further investigation, it seemed that Boolean properties just weren’t rendered correctly. The default interpolation method used by the Animate class is the NumberInterpolator – which provides interpolation between start and end values represented as Number instances. Now Boolean true and false can be represented as Number values 1 and 0, so I would have expected it to work. But the interpolated number sequence when interpolating between 1 and 0 would obviously pose a problem, when my component was expecting a simple 1 or 0. Which led me to the idea of a BooleanInterpolator.

The BooleanInterpolator  
-----------------------

I won’t expand on the implementation here, as it’s not necessary. I simply implemented the IInterpolator interface, and fixed the interpolated values to either 1 or 0, and it worked!

You can [download the BooleanInterpolator here](http://blog.tiltdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/BooleanInterpolator.as).

So, there we have it. A way of Animating between Boolean values, suitable for use in Spark Transitions.

And there we have it. Pretty simple really. There’s always another way of skinning a cat, so please let me know if you’ve faced a similar problem before and used an entirely different solution.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Finding An HtmlLoader DOM Element’s Absolute Position in Adobe AIR]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Being a Flash developer, and not an HTML/Javascript developer, I mistakenly thought that retrieving the absolute x/y coordinates of an element loaded into the DOM of Air’s HTMLLoader might be easy – I was wrong :(</p>

<p>I needed to find the exact position of a Captcha image within the loaded page, in order to do a BitmapData.draw on it. After an initial Google, it seemed there are decent Javascript functions that might achieve this, but the problem lay in not having any control over the contents of the page I was loading. Adding addition Javascript functionality to the page wasn’t an option – Big, bad DOM to the rescue!</p>

<h2 id="usejavascripttofindposition">USE JAVASCRIPT TO FIND POSITION  </h2>

<p>Below, is the Javascript function chosen to get the Element’s absolute page position. I’ve collapsed it by default, as is long and er.. Javascript.</p>

<p>I won’t go into the code, but suffice to say that it does indeed correctly return the absolute position of an element. Credit should go to Peter-Paul Koch and Alex Tingle for the solution!</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function findPositionX(obj)  
{
    var left = 0;
    if(obj.offsetParent)
    {
        while(1)
        {
          left += obj.offsetLeft;
          if(!obj.offsetParent)
            break;
          obj = obj.offsetParent;
        }
    }
    else if(obj.x)
    {
        left += obj.x;
    }
    return left;
}

function findPosY(obj)  
{
    var top = 0;
    if(obj.offsetParent)
    {
        while(1)
        {
          top += obj.offsetTop;
          if(!obj.offsetParent)
            break;
          obj = obj.offsetParent;
        }
    }
    else if(obj.y)
    {
        top += obj.y;
    }
    return top;
  }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="injectjavascriptintohtmlloadersdom">INJECT JAVASCRIPT INTO HTMLLOADER’S DOM  </h2>

<p>Now, to get the Javascript into our DOM, thereby effectively injecting it into the page we just loaded. This is a fairly easy process, and no-doubt one that will be pretty familiar to even the most novice HTML Developers, but for us Flash devs, this may not be so obvious. Once the HTMLLoader Event.COMPLETE has been fired, you can then retrieve the resulting Document Object Model, in order to inject our new Javascript functions, from the HTMLLoader.</p>

<p>Below, we create a new javascript element ‘Script’, and set it’s text property with the Javascript we want to inject, before appending the new element to the ‘head’ of the HTML page in the DOM.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">script = loader.window.document.createElement("script")  
script.type = "text/javascript"  
script.text = "function findPositionX(obj) { ---- }";  
loader.window.document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild( script );  
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you inspect the DOM, you’ll see the page you previously loaded, contains the Javascript we just injected – cool huh!</p>

<h2 id="puttingitintoaction">PUTTING IT INTO ACTION  </h2>

<p>So, now we have a Web page we had no control over, loaded into our HTMLLoader, will the Javascript functionlity to get our elements absolute position, added to the DOM. We can now simply retrieve a reference to our object from the DOM, and pass to the findPositionX and findPositionY functions to retrieve the position, as such…</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">captchaImage = dom.getElementById( "imgCaptcha" );

xPos = loader.window.findPositionX( captchaImage );  
yPos = loader.window.findPositionY( captchaImage );

bitmapData.draw( loader, null, null, null,  
    new Rectangle( xPos, yPos, captchaImage.width, captchaImage.height ) );
